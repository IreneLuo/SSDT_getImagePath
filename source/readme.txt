main_namedpipe_1.c
Writing according to msdn's client example.
can send image path to server and get reply from server, but will get error (named pipe close : error code 997)

main_namedpipe_2.c
modify from ver1, can send ImagePath to server and receive ImagePath from server.
Just wanna test the receive message belongs to client.
